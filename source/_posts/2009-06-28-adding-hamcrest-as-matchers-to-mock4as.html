<div class='post'>
<p>Just a quick post to mention that I recently did an experiment with extending mock4as to use <a href="http://drewbourne.github.com/">Drew Bourne</a>'s awesome <a href="http://github.com/drewbourne/hamcrest-as3">hamcrest-as3</a>.</p>
<p>The idea for this work is to specify mocked method arguments in a more flexible way. It was actually surprisingly trivial to implement. I'll be writing a more detailed post in the future explaining what these changes mean to a user of mock4as.
</p><p>I also took the opportunity to experiment with using git and github, so the changes are available to all and sundry as a <a href="http://github.com/moredip/mock4as">github repository</a>. I will be talking to the mock4as guys about getting my changes merged into the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mock4as/">official mock4as codebase</a>
