Some colleagues at Thoughtworks and I recently recorded a 30 minute podcast about <a href="http://github.com/moredip/frank">Frank</a>, our UI automation tool for iPhone/iPad testing which I introduced in <a href="http://blog.thepete.net/2010/07/frank-automated-acceptance-tests-for.html">this post</a>.<br />
<br />
In the podcast we cover:<br />
<ul><li>an overview of Frank, what it is and where it came from.</li>
<li>How our testers and developers use Frank and cucumber at our current client (and how we'd ideally <i>like</i> to be using it).</li>
<li>Alternatives to Frank, such as <a href="http://github.com/unboxed/icuke">iCuke</a> and <a href="http://github.com/undees/brominet">brominet</a>.</li>
<li>Some waffling by me about some of the reasoning that drove my design decisions with Frank. For example, avoiding XML and XPath for UI element selection.</li>
<li>Symbiote, the little web app that we embed inside Frank which allows a test creator to inspect and play with the live iOS app as it's running.</li>
<li>Writing cucumber feature files per-story versus per-feature.</li>
<li>Handling the stateful nature of an iOS app in UI-level tests, and including Frank testing into a Continuous Integration system.</li>
<li>The challenges of testing an app which integrates with large back-end systems.</li>
<li>What's next for Frank.</li>
</ul><br />
Many thanks to Chris Stephenson for organizing and facilitating, and to Derek and Hiyasmin for tolerating my hogging of the mike!<br />
