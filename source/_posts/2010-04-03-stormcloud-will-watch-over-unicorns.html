<p>Hipster geeks crack me up. A nice ancillary benefit of being in this industry is I get to read blog posts about interesting technical stuff which also include phrases such as:</p><br />
<blockquote>...we developed a new monitoring script, called Stormcloud, to kill Unicorns when they ran out of control...<br />
<br />
...Monit would still monitor the master Unicorn process, but Stormcloud would watch over the Unicorns...<br />
<br />
...child death during request processing ... would cause that request and all requests queued in the mongrel to send 500 "robot" errors until the mongrel had been restarted...<br />
</blockquote><br />
<p>No need to fear, children. Stormcloud will watch over the unicorns. And if all else fails, a mongrel will send 500 robot errors.</p><br />
<p>In case you were wondering, <a href="http://engineering.twitter.com/2010/03/unicorn-power.html">the blog post these come from</a> is about Twitter's app server infrastructure.</p></div>
