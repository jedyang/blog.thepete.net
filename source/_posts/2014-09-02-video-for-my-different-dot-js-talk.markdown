I had the opportunity to present at [Forward JS](http://forwardjs.com/) a few weeks ago on "different.js". No, the presentation wasn't about a new, shiny, artisinally-crafted micro-framework. I talked about how to "level up" at JavaScript by introducing artificial constraints which force you to approach things a different way. I worked through a specific example, abstaining from the use of `this` and prototypes in favor of closures.

Slides for the talk are [here](https://speakerdeck.com/phodgson/different-dot-js-forward-js-2014), video is below (thanks [New Circle](https://thenewcircle.com/s/post/1656/differentjs_video_forward_js)).
