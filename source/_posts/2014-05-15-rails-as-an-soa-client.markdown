I got to present a talk at [RailsConf](http://railsconf.com/) this year. video is [here](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/3347-railsconf-rails-as-an-soa-client), slides are [here](https://speakerdeck.com/phodgson/railsconf2014).

My talk was about Rails as an SOA client. I talked about things like Conway's Law, Contract Testing, Hexagonal Architecture, the faraday gem, and HTTP Caching.
