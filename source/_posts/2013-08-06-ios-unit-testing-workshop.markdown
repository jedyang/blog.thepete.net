##TL;DR
I'll be running a couple of free workshops on iOS Unit Testing in San Francisco in late August/early September. If you'd like to attend please fill out [this simple form](https://docs.google.com/a/thoughtworks.com/forms/d/1L4smy4zlV6xP0Ufy_i3GjuhAW64xXzqsmbCGXkCXblA/viewform) and I'll be in touch with details.

##Why is it free? What's the catch?

As part of the super-awesome StrangeLoop conference I'm going to be running a [paid 3 hour workshop on iOS unit testing](https://thestrangeloop.com/sessions/unit-testing-for-ios). In prepration for that I'll be doing a couple of 'dry runs' of the workshop so I can fine tune the content, delivery, pacing, etc. You are cordially invited to attend. In exchange for some free learning about iOS unit testing all I ask for is some of your weekend, and 10 minutes after the workshop is over for feedback on what was good and what could be improved. A win/win for everyone I hope.

##Details on the workshop
Learn the why and the how of unit-testing for your iOS applications using Kiwi, a popular open-source testing library.

this workshop excited to apply what you’ve learned to start testing your iOS app. In fact, you’ll probably want to fire up your project in XCode straight afterwards!

We’ll start with the basics, covering what unit-testing is (and isn’t), and why it will be a valuable addition to your programming toolbox.

Having touching on some theory we’ll then spend the majority of the workshop learning by doing. We’ll start by setting up an xCode project for testing with Kiwi, and quickly move on to writing our first simple test.

After learning the basics with some isolated examples we’ll move on to look at how to unit tests an real iOS app. As we go we’ll learn about mocking and stubbing, and when to make the decision not to test. We’ll learn how to test in the context of a CocoaTouch app, and how testing can positively influence the design of your app (hint: your app delegate and your view controller isn’t the only place to put your business logic!).

We’ll wrap up by touching on some more advanced topics such as test-driven development, CI, and how to test asynchronous code.
