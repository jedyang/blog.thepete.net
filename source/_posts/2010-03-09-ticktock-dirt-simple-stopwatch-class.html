<div class='post'>
I just threw together a really straightforward stopwatch class, for use when profiling operations in ActionScript code. You can either use it in an old-skool procedural way:

<pre class="brush: as3; gutter: false">
var tt:TickTock = new TickTock();
tt.start();
doSomeWork();
tt.stop();
trace( "That took "+tickTock.elapsedTimeInMilliseconds+" millisconds" );
</pre>

or in a fancy-pants, functional, closure-y way:

<pre class="brush: as3; gutter: false">
var tt:TickTock = TickTock.measure( function(){
  doSomeWork();
});
trace( "That took "+tickTock.elapsedTimeInMilliseconds+" millisconds" );
</pre>

Being primarily a ruby guy, I prefer the fancy-pants approach ;)

The class, along with a little sample app, is <a href="http://github.com/moredip/TickTock">up on GitHub now</a>.</div>
