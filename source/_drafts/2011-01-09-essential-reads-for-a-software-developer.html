<p><a href="http://amzn.com/020161622X">Pragmatic Programmer</a>:
Covers basic low-level design best practices as well as many of the foundational practices all developers should be following (testing,version control,refactoring). </p> 
 
<p><a href="http://amzn.com/0735619670">Code Complete</a>:
Similar content to The Pragmatic Programmer. More indepth, a little more reasoned but also a little drier.</p> 
 
<p><a href="http://amzn.com/0321503627">Growing Object-Oriented Software Guided By Tests</a> 
The main focus of this book is about building software using the &lsquo;London School&rsquo; of TDD, but along the way it describes the kind of advanced OO design which takes years to fully grok.</p> 
 
<p><a href="http://amzn.com/0201485672">Refactoring</a>:
Thorough and readable description of a core developer practice.</p> 
 
<p><a href="http://amzn.com/0132350882">Clean Code</a>:
Opinionated but full of very useful guidance on OO design. </p> 
 
<p><a href="http://amzn.com/0321146530">Test-Driven Development: By Example</a>:
Maybe a little dated now, but a great introduction to the foundational principle of TDD</p> 
 
<p><a href="http://amzn.com/0321278658">Extreme Programming Explained</a>:
A little dated at this point (although I haven&rsquo;t read the 2nd edition). Provides a nice short intro to agile practices couched in relatively developer-centric terms.</p> 
 
<p><a href="http://amzn.com/0321213351">Refactoring to Patterns</a> 
A higher level look at ways to apply the practice of refactoring to evolve towards Patterns. A good way to solidify your understanding of the practice of refactoring.</p> 
 
<p><a href="http://amzn.com/0596529260">RESTful Web Services</a>: 
Pragmatic but principled coverage on building RESTful services. </p> 
 
<p><a href="http://amzn.com/1934356050">Pragmatic Thinking &amp; Learning: Refactor Your Wetware</a>:
The only non-technical book in my list, but one of the more valuable. Your entire career revolves around problem solving and interacting with people. Get better at both.</p> 
 
<p><a href="http://amzn.com/0131495054">xUnit Test Patterns</a>:
Encyclopedic coverage of unit testing patterns and practices.</p> 
 
<p><a href="http://amzn.com/0131177052">Working Effectively with Legacy Code</a>:
Absolutely required reading for every developer on how to maintain and extend existing systems.</p> 
 
<p><a href="http://amzn.com/0321127420">Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</a>:
Full to the brim with higher-level design/architecture patterns, some of which are applicable to most any large software systems. </p> 
 
<p>Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture (POSA) <a href="http://amzn.com/0471958697">Volume 1</a>, <a href="http://amzn.com/0471606952">Volume 2</a>, <a href="http://amzn.com/0470059028">Volume 4</a>:
Rather dated, and a bit dry and academic, but some often-overlooked gems can be found in here. For example, lots of coverage of event-driven patterns now made trendy by Node.js, Event Machine et al.</p> 
 
<p><a href="http://amzn.com/0136291554">Object-Oriented Software Construction</a>:
Old and fairly academic, but lots of stuff that&rsquo;s still relevant. Meyer&rsquo;s Design By Contract approach is definitely something more developers should be exposed to.</p> 
 
<p><a href="http://amzn.com/0321413091">Implementation Patterns</a>:
A straightforward explanation of the low-level code design tricks which seasoned developers learn through years of practices. You will apply lessons from this book on a daily basis.</p> 
 
<p><a href="http://amzn.com/0596007124">Head First Design Patterns</a>:
While the original Gang of Four <a href="http://amzn.com/0201633612">Design Patterns</a> book is obviously the canonical source, this book presents the core patterns in a more digestable, modern form.</p> 
 
<p><a href="http://amzn.com/0321125215">Domain Driven Design</a>:
This is really two books in one. The first half covers useful mid-to-high level &lsquo;tactical&rsquo; issues, introducing a set of highly-regarded design patterns. The second half covers high-level &lsquo;strategic&rsquo; issues which span teams and multiple co-dependent code bases.</p> 
 
<p><a href="http://amzn.com/0978739213">Release It!</a>: 
Written long before the DevOps movement took off, this is a great resource for developers who care about the production life of the systems they help create.</p> 
 
<p><a href="http://amzn.com/0262011530">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)</a>: 
I haven&rsquo;t finished reading it, but I feel like I should have. Subtle, math-heavy, and mind-altering.</p></div>
